    "Ans: try statement is used for exception handling in python. it consists of a block of risky statements which might cause an exception during runtime. if code within try block raises exception, then the exception will be reverted to the corresponding except block if multiple except blocks are present, else it willbe reverted to the default except block. In short try and except in union avoid programs from crashing during runtime due to exceptions."
